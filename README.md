# My Python scripts

Little python scripts I made to make my life easier.

**Note** - All my code is for Python 3.


### Contents

* [Twitter Follow Machine](TwitterFollowMachine) - A script to follow accounts on Twitter based on certain interests.
* [Emoji Server](EmojiServer) - Offline version of the awesome Github emoji selector/finder by [@muan](https://github.com/muan)
* [Name Order Fixer](NameOrderFix) - Pads zeros in numbers of filenames to make them uniform
* [anime.thehylia soundtrack downloader](TheHyliaSoundtrack) - Download a [anime.thehylia](http://anime.thehylia.com/) soundtrack album at once. You may also generate a plain text file with direct links to mp3's instead.
* [AES Encryption](AES-Encrypt) - Simple command-line tool to encrypt/decrypt strings.


#### Others

* [AudioVideoAutoMerge](Others/AudioVideoAutoMerge.py) - A very raw script to auto-merge all audio-video streams contained in a folder. It automatically detects pairs of audio-video files and merges them using *ffmpeg*.
